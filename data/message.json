  "dailyMessage": "Happy Valentine’s Day my Love ❤️. A year ago we spent a sloppy valentines in Chicago, and a year later we find ourselves on the brink of an Asia trip together… I am really looking forward to the quality time together. I’m thankful to have a valentine that is happy when they are with me and brings out a happier version of myself, that sees the world of opportunity around me. Today, I really enjoyed sitting outside sharing a pastry. It reminds me of the kinda of new experiences we used to share when we first met and the ones we continue to have in other cities and when we travel. I love experiences like that and I hope we continue to look to experience new things every day. New places, food, hobbies, all of the above. I want to try it all together."
